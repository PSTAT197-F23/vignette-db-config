## Vignette Abstract

This vignette, created as a final project for PSTAT197A in Fall 2023, provides a detailed guide on configuring a database and writing queries in R, using European football data. The dataset covers the Top 5 leagues in Europe from 2014-2020 and is structured as a relational database with seven separate CSV files: appearances, games, leagues, players, shots, teams, and teamstats. The example demonstrates the process of connecting to a database, adding relations, writing tables, and executing queries to gather relevant data. Additionally, the vignette explores the construction of predictive models in R using the assembled tables.
