## Let's go through some more example queries and introduce a few more essential concepts


# CONCEPT 1: CREATING COLUMNS
#   Creating and modifying columns enables us to derive new data from existing datasets, 
#   enhancing our ability to analyze and understand our data.


# Example 1.1) This query adds together the yellowCard and redCard columns to create a new column totalCards. 
# Thus indicating the total number of cards a player received in a game.
dbGetQuery(soccer_con, "SELECT playerID, gameID, (yellowCard + redCard) AS totalCards
                        FROM appearances
                        LIMIT 50")

# Example 1.2) This query adds the homeGoals and awayGoals columns to create a new column totalGoals.
# Thus indicating the total number of goals scored in each game.
dbGetQuery(soccer_con, "SELECT gameID, homeGoals, awayGoals, homeGoals + awayGoals AS totalGoals
                        FROM games")

# Example 1.3) This query creates a new column uniqueID by concatenating playerID and gameID with a hyphen in between.
dbGetQuery(soccer_con, "SELECT playerID, gameID, playerID || '-' || gameID AS uniqueID
                        FROM appearances")


# CONCEPT 2: AGGREGATION FUNCTIONS
#   Aggregation functions enable us to find averages, maximums, minimums, counts, sums, etc. 


# Example 2.1) This query calculates the AVERAGE number of goals scored by each team in each season.
dbGetQuery(soccer_con, "SELECT teamID, season, AVG(goals) AS average_goals
                        FROM teamstats
                        GROUP BY teamID, season
                        LIMIT 50")

# Example 2.2) This query finds the MAXIMUM and MINIMUM number of fouls committed in a single game across all records.
dbGetQuery(soccer_con, "SELECT MAX(fouls) AS max_fouls, MIN(fouls) AS min_fouls
                        FROM teamstats")

# Example 2.3) This query COUNTS the number of wins ('W'), losses ('L'), and draws ('D') for each team.
dbGetQuery(soccer_con, "SELECT teamID, result, COUNT(*) AS game_count
                        FROM teamstats
                        GROUP BY teamID, result
                        LIMIT 50")

# Example 2.4) This query SUMS up the total number of shots and shots on target for home ('h') and away ('a') games separately.
dbGetQuery(soccer_con, "SELECT location, SUM(shots) AS total_shots, SUM(shotsOnTarget) AS shots_on_target
                        FROM teamstats
                        GROUP BY location")


# CONCEPT 3: SUBQUERIES
#   Subqueries are a powerful feature that allow us to use the result of one query as a condition or reference in another.
#   Thus enabling complex and layered data analysis within a single statement.


# Example 3.1)
# This query finds the percentage of each type of shotResult within the Shots table.
# In this example, the subquery is used to calculate the total number of shots in the dataset
# This is a necessary step to determine the percentage of each shot result
dbGetQuery(soccer_con, "SELECT shotResult, 
                               COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM shots) AS percentage
                        FROM shots
                        GROUP BY shotResult")

# Example 3.2)
# In this query, the subquery shooterAverages calculates the average xGoal for each shooterID.
# The main query then selects those shooters whose average xGoal is higher than the overall average xGoal calculated across all shots. 
# Ultimately, we find the shooters that have a higher average xGoal than the average xGoal across the table.
dbGetQuery(soccer_con, "SELECT shooterID AS bestShooters
                        FROM (
                              SELECT shooterID, AVG(xGoal) AS avgShooterXGoal
                              FROM shots
                              GROUP BY shooterID) AS shooterAverages
                        WHERE avgShooterXGoal > (
                              SELECT AVG(xGoal) FROM shots)
                        LIMIT 50")
